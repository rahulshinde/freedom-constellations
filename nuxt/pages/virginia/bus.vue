        text="The unveiling of the bus happened directly below the monumental portraits on City Hall. It was super inspiring to think of City Hall as the central star of Freedom Constellations, and the bus as the vehicle for bringing these message of hope and justice to people and communities across the city. 

***This was the first ever collaboration for the GRTC Transit System with nonprofit and philanthropic partners and it's their hope that it kicks off a series of bus wraps featuring different community groups who are important to GRTC ridership!

Huge thanks to CultureWorks Richmond and GRTC for making this possible! And to Fuji Film for lending us a camera powerful enough to make these monumental portraits pop!"
